What is ChanL?
--------------

"Wh-what you have to understand is that-that ChanL is not a big blob of state. When you have a lot
of global state with lots of threads, you need to, you need to lock it down. It's like a truck, and
if too many people try to use that truck, you, you get problems.  ChanL is not a big truck. It's a
series--it's a series of *tubes*."
  - Sen. Ted Stevens

In a nutshell, you create various processes sequentially executing tasks you need done,
and use channel objects to communicate and synchronize the state of these processes.

Examples
--------

Some examples:

create a channel:

     (defvar *c* (make-channel))

create a buffered channel with a buffer size of 5. Buffered channels do not block on
send until their buffer is full, or on recv until their buffer is empty.

     (defvar *c* (make-channel 5))

read a value from a channel (blocks if channel is empty)

     (recv *c*)

write a value to a channel (blocks if channel is full, always blocks on unbuffered channels)

     (send *c* 99)

wait for any of a number of things to occur:

     (select
       ((recv sync)
        (print "got some value from sync~%"))
       ((recv c d)
        (format t "got ~a from c~%" d))
       ((send e val)
        (print "sent val on e~%"))
       ((recv f (&key arg reply))
        (format t "got arg ~a, reply ~a~% from f" f arg reply))
       ((seq-recv *lots-of-channels* x)
        (format t "Received ~A from one of the *l-o-c* channels" x))
       (otherwise
        (print "would have blocked~%")))

create a new process continually reading values and printing them:

     (pexec (:name "Formatter process")
       (loop (format t "~a~%" (recv *c*))))

create a new process that runs a function:

     (pcall #'my-function :name "My function is running!")

Also, you can refer to the examples/ directory for some runnable examples of
how ChanL can be used. Currently there is a parallel prime sieve algorithm
translated from Newsqueak.
