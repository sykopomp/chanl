;; support for CSP-style channels.
;; ported from plan9's libthread/channel.c via plan9port
;; by roger peppe (rog@vitanuova.com).
;;
;; see http://swtch.com/~rsc/thread/ for a good position paper on
;; the CSP paradigm, or http://www.usingcsp.com/cspbook.pdf
;; for some theory.
;;
;; e.g.
;; create a channel:
;;    (defvar *c* (chan))
;; create a buffered channel with a buffer size of 5
;;    (defvar *c* (chan 5))
;; read a value from a channel (blocks if channel is empty)
;;    (? *c*)
;; write a value to a channel (blocks if channel is full)
;;    (! *c* 99)
;; wait for any of a number of things to occur:
;;    (alt
;;        ((? sync)
;;            (format t "got some value from sync~%"))
;;        ((? c d)
;;            (format t "got ~a from c~%" d))
;;        ((! e val)
;;            (format t "sent val on e~%"))
;;        ((? f (&key arg reply))
;;            (format t "got arg ~a, reply ~a~% from f" f arg reply))
;;        (:*
;;            (format t "would have blocked~%")))"
;; create a new process continually reading values and printing them:
;;    (spawn (loop (format t "~a~%" (? *c*))))
;;
;; TO DO:
;; - thread termination (need to unlock *chanlock* correctly).
;; - default handler for new threads? - wtf?
;; - Get this to play nice with the condition system

   be evaluated, otherwise the alt blocks until a clause becomes ready.
   When a clause becomes ready, its associated forms are evaluated.

   is bound to the values in lambda-list as for destructuring-bind.
